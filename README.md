# The-Gaming-Room

In this document I was instructed to develop a software design document for a client The Gaming Room. They were interested in taking a game they had created and 
moving it to other platforms to expand their customer base. The document was created with the purpose of going over what our recommendations were as well as 
what the code would have to look like for our team through a UML design. 
I believe I did well with constraints as well as the domain model. By having these two parts solid we can identify the hardest parts of the task and make sure
we are aware of them early and not suprised later on which could end up costing the client or our team by spending lost hours on something that could have 
been avoided. 
When working through this document I found when it was time to write the code that it made it easier. By understanding what the client was looking for I could
then translate that into the code to ensure the most satisfaction possible. 
The part of the document I feel is the weakest in the evaluation or the recommendation section. I was having trouble finding the best information possible so 
some of my recommendations were based just on what I could find in a few hours times. If I were to improve upon this section I would spend more time doing as 
deep of research as I could into all available systems and servers.
I interpreted the user's needs to the best of my ability. Only being able to read one sheet of requirments and wants is good but being able to talk with the 
client face to face to find what they wanted would be better. It is vital to consider the user's needs when designing because their happiness is the end goal.
You have to be able to create something that in the end will make the user happy. If they decide to spend their money on you then that is there investment
and you have to make sure that is wasn't for naught.
This was something very new to me so I was very concerned in the beginning. I was luckily able to find what I needed through in depth searches and reading materials
provided by the class. In the future I would continue to find help online if I need it or ask peers or coworkers for advice. I like learning new things so if there
is ever somewhere I get stuck I do not what someone else to just solve it I want to learn how to solve it. My number one best strategy is not getting behind on
things. I hate when I have to rush so I always plan ahead and make sure I have enough time to complete my work and complete it to the best of my abilities.
